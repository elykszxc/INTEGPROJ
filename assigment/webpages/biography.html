    <p> <blockquote> <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born and raised in Manila, and growing up as a child was great.  <sup>1</sup> My earliest memories are filled with carefree days spent playing outside with friends, and only worrying about what games to play, and who to play it with. <sup>2</sup> Although my family wasn't whole, I was still surrounded by love and encouragement, which shaped my personality. <sup>3</sup> My parents always emphasized the importance of education and hard work, instilling in me values that I carry to this day. <sup>4</sup> I spent most of my time outside, playing basketball, and games like patintero and habulan. <sup>5</sup> Sometimes my friends and I stayed up late just talking to each other with each of our own stories. <sup>6</sup> School was an exciting adventure, and I eagerly absorbed knowledge, excelling in subjects that piqued my curiosity. <sup>7</sup> I remember the first time I joined a major competition, a spelling bee, however I only got 2nd place. But it still made a big impact in my life, because I was actually good at it, which made learning enjoyable. <sup>8</sup> My childhood was also marked by small yet significant lessons in resilience and determination, whether it was overcoming fears, making new friends, or dealing with challenges. <sup>9</sup> Weekends were often spent at my dad's side, and weekdays at my mom's side, where both gave me a strong appreciation for family. <sup>10</sup> Summers were the highlight of my childhood, because as a child, no classes were the best. <sup>11</sup> I had a strong imagination, often creating stories and games that made every day feel like an adventure.  <sup>12</sup>Looking back, I cherish the innocence and curiosity that defined those early years. <sup>13</sup> The friendships I made during this time, though some faded over time, played a vital role in shaping my social skills. <sup>14</sup> I also remember moments of failure, whether it was losing that spelling bee or quiz bee, or struggling with a difficult lesson, but they only pushed me to try harder. <sup>15</sup> My childhood wasn’t without challenges, but those experiences taught me patience, perseverance, and the ability to adapt. <sup>16</sup> I was always eager to learn new things, whether it was how to ride a bike,  or build a school project from scratch. <sup>17</sup> My parents often shared stories about their struggles and successes, inspiring me to dream big. <sup>18</sup> Holidays were filled with laughter, family gatherings, and cherished traditions. <sup>19</sup> My curiosity led me to explore different hobbies, from basketball to playing the guitar, shaping my interests. <sup>20</sup> Though I didn't know it then, the experiences of my childhood laid the foundation for the person I would become.

    <p> <blockquote> <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My teenage years were a time of self-discovery, growth, and navigating new experiences. <sup>1</sup> Transitioning into high school, I was introduced to a world of challenges, responsibilities, and independence. <sup>2</sup> The excitement of meeting new friends, getting a girlfriend, and learning new things shaped my social life. <sup>3</sup> I found myself drawn to programming, that would later influence my career choices. <sup>4</sup> It was also a time of self-doubt and uncertainty, as I tried to figure out my strengths, weaknesses, and personal goals. <sup>5</sup> Relationships with others became more complex, and I learned that not all of them lasted forever, but those that did were built on trust and understanding. <sup>61</sup> The pressure of academic performance, social expectations, and personal growth sometimes felt overwhelming, but I learned to balance everything through time management and perseverance. <sup>6</sup> I discovered my passions more deeply, such as playing the guitar, in which I really enjoyed, and playing basketball. <sup>7</sup> I really tried to excel in areas that brought me joy. <sup>8</sup> There were moments of rebellion and pushing boundaries, as I tried to understand my own identity and values. <sup>9</sup> My teenage years were also filled with countless firsts—first achievements, first failures, and first experiences that shaped my confidence and perspective. <sup>10</sup> I became more independent, taking on responsibilities at home and in school that prepared me for adulthood. <sup>11</sup> The struggles of navigating teenage emotions, friendships, and academics were challenging, but they built my resilience.  <sup>12</sup>I learned that failure wasn’t the end but rather an opportunity to grow and improve. <sup>13</sup> A certain teacher played a significant role in guiding and inspiring me to pursue the IT course, encouraging me to think critically and creatively. <sup>14</sup> There were unforgettable moments, school trips, and competitions that became treasured memories.  <sup>15</sup> I also became more aware of the world around me, developing opinions on social issues and discovering my voice. <sup>16</sup>  This period was about finding balance—between ambition and rest, friendships and solitude, dreams and reality. <sup>17</sup> I learned to embrace change, accept challenges, and appreciate the journey of self-improvement. <sup>18</sup> My teenage years were not perfect, but they were an essential chapter in shaping who I was becoming. <sup>19</sup> To sum it all up, this was the most relevant part of my life. <sup>20</sup> My teenage years shaped my whole personality, and I have no regrets with who I became, and who I will become in the future.

    <p> <blockquote> <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting college was both exciting and overwhelming for me. <sup>1</sup> As an Information Technology (IT) student, I was eager to learn about programming, networking, and how technology shapes the world. <sup>2</sup> The first year was all about adjusting to the workload, managing my time, and understanding the basics of my course. <sup>3</sup> Now that I am in my second year and preparing for my third, I feel more confident in my skills and knowledge. <sup>4</sup> I have tackled subjects that challenged me, especially coding and technical problem-solving, but I enjoy learning new things. <sup>5</sup> There are days when projects and deadlines pile up, making college stressful, but I remind myself that this is part of the learning process. <sup>6</sup> Late-night study sessions, debugging errors for hours, and preparing for exams have all become part of my routine. <sup>7</sup> Despite the challenges, I appreciate every lesson because it helps me grow as an IT student. <sup>8</sup> I have met classmates who share the same passion, and working with them on projects makes learning more enjoyable. <sup>9</sup> Joining school activities and IT-related events has also given me a broader perspective on the industry. <sup>10</sup> While I have not yet experienced an internship, I am excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a real work setting soon. <sup>11</sup> I look forward to learning from professionals and understanding how the industry operates. <sup>12</sup> College has also taught me important life skills like responsibility, teamwork, and time management. <sup>13</sup> There are days when I feel pressured, but I always remind myself why I chose this path. <sup>14</sup> I know that every line of code I write and every problem I solve brings me one step closer to my future career. <sup>15</sup> My professors have been a great help, guiding and challenging me to improve my skills. <sup>16</sup> I am also learning how to balance academics with self-care to avoid burnout. <sup>17</sup> The transition from second to third year feels like a big step, but I am ready to face new challenges. <sup>18</sup> I know the subjects will get harder, but I am determined to push through and continue improving. <sup>19</sup> College is not just about academics—it is also about personal growth and discovering what I am truly capable of. <sup>20</sup> Every experience, whether good or bad, is shaping me into the IT professional I aspire to be. <sup>21</sup>
