    <blockquote>
      <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born and raised in Manila, and growing up as a child was great.
        <sup>1</sup> My earliest memories are filled with carefree days spent playing outside with friends, and only
        worrying about what games to play, and who to play it with. <sup>2</sup> Although my family wasn't whole, I was
        still surrounded by love and encouragement, which shaped my personality. <sup>3</sup> My parents always
        emphasized the importance of education and hard work, instilling in me values that I carry to this day.
        <sup>4</sup> I spent most of my time outside, playing basketball, and games like patintero and habulan.
        <sup>5</sup> Sometimes my friends and I stayed up late just talking to each other with each of our own stories.
        <sup>6</sup> School was an exciting adventure, and I eagerly absorbed knowledge, excelling in subjects that
        piqued my curiosity. <sup>7</sup> I remember the first time I joined a major competition, a spelling bee,
        however I only got 2nd place. But it still made a big impact in my life, because I was actually good at it,
        which made learning enjoyable. <sup>8</sup> My childhood was also marked by small yet significant lessons in
        resilience and determination, whether it was overcoming fears, making new friends, or dealing with challenges.
        <sup>9</sup> Weekends were often spent at my dad's side, and weekdays at my mom's side, where both gave me a
        strong appreciation for family. <sup>10</sup> Summers were the highlight of my childhood, because as a child, no
        classes were the best. <sup>11</sup> I had a strong imagination, often creating stories and games that made
        every day feel like an adventure. <sup>12</sup>Looking back, I cherish the innocence and curiosity that defined
        those early years. <sup>13</sup> The friendships I made during this time, though some faded over time, played a
        vital role in shaping my social skills. <sup>14</sup> I also remember moments of failure, whether it was losing
        that spelling bee or quiz bee, or struggling with a difficult lesson, but they only pushed me to try harder.
        <sup>15</sup> My childhood wasn’t without challenges, but those experiences taught me patience, perseverance,
        and the ability to adapt. <sup>16</sup> I was always eager to learn new things, whether it was how to ride a
        bike, or build a school project from scratch. <sup>17</sup> My parents often shared stories about their
        struggles and successes, inspiring me to dream big. <sup>18</sup> Holidays were filled with laughter, family
        gatherings, and cherished traditions. <sup>19</sup> My curiosity led me to explore different hobbies, from
        basketball to playing the guitar, shaping my interests. <sup>20</sup> Though I didn't know it then, the
        experiences of my childhood laid the foundation for the person I would become.

    <blockquote>
      <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My teenage years were a time of self-discovery, growth, and
        navigating new experiences. <sup>1</sup> Transitioning into high school, I was introduced to a world of
        challenges, responsibilities, and independence. <sup>2</sup> The excitement of meeting new friends, getting a
        girlfriend, and learning new things shaped my social life. <sup>3</sup> I found myself drawn to programming,
        that would later influence my career choices. <sup>4</sup> It was also a time of self-doubt and uncertainty, as
        I tried to figure out my strengths, weaknesses, and personal goals. <sup>5</sup> Relationships with others
        became more complex, and I learned that not all of them lasted forever, but those that did were built on trust
        and understanding. <sup>61</sup> The pressure of academic performance, social expectations, and personal growth
        sometimes felt overwhelming, but I learned to balance everything through time management and perseverance.
        <sup>6</sup> I discovered my passions more deeply, such as playing the guitar, in which I really enjoyed, and
        playing basketball. <sup>7</sup> I really tried to excel in areas that brought me joy. <sup>8</sup> There were
        moments of rebellion and pushing boundaries, as I tried to understand my own identity and values. <sup>9</sup>
        My teenage years were also filled with countless firsts—first achievements, first failures, and first
        experiences that shaped my confidence and perspective. <sup>10</sup> I became more independent, taking on
        responsibilities at home and in school that prepared me for adulthood. <sup>11</sup> The struggles of navigating
        teenage emotions, friendships, and academics were challenging, but they built my resilience. <sup>12</sup>I
        learned that failure wasn’t the end but rather an opportunity to grow and improve. <sup>13</sup> A certain
        teacher played a significant role in guiding and inspiring me to pursue the IT course, encouraging me to think
        critically and creatively. <sup>14</sup> There were unforgettable moments, school trips, and competitions that
        became treasured memories. <sup>15</sup> I also became more aware of the world around me, developing opinions on
        social issues and discovering my voice. <sup>16</sup> This period was about finding balance—between ambition and
        rest, friendships and solitude, dreams and reality. <sup>17</sup> I learned to embrace change, accept
        challenges, and appreciate the journey of self-improvement. <sup>18</sup> My teenage years were not perfect, but
        they were an essential chapter in shaping who I was becoming. <sup>19</sup> To sum it all up, this was the most
        relevant part of my life. <sup>20</sup> My teenage years shaped my whole personality, and I have no regrets with
        who I became, and who I will become in the future.

      <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting college was both exciting and overwhelming for me.
        <sup>1</sup> As an Information Technology (IT) student, I was eager to learn about programming, networking, and
        how technology shapes the world. <sup>2</sup> The first year was all about adjusting to the workload, managing
        my time, and understanding the basics of my course. <sup>3</sup> Now that I am in my second year and preparing
        for my third, I feel more confident in my skills and knowledge. <sup>4</sup> I have tackled subjects that
        challenged me, especially coding and technical problem-solving, but I enjoy learning new things. <sup>5</sup>
        There are days when projects and deadlines pile up, making college stressful, but I remind myself that this is
        part of the learning process. <sup>6</sup> Late-night study sessions, debugging errors for hours, and preparing
        for exams have all become part of my routine. <sup>7</sup> Despite the challenges, I appreciate every lesson
        because it helps me grow as an IT student. <sup>8</sup> I have met classmates who share the same passion, and
        working with them on projects makes learning more enjoyable. <sup>9</sup> Joining school activities and
        IT-related events has also given me a broader perspective on the industry. <sup>10</sup> While I have not yet
        experienced an internship, I am excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a real work setting soon.
        <sup>11</sup> I look forward to learning from professionals and understanding how the industry operates.
        <sup>12</sup> College has also taught me important life skills like responsibility, teamwork, and time
        management. <sup>13</sup> There are days when I feel pressured, but I always remind myself why I chose this
        path. <sup>14</sup> I know that every line of code I write and every problem I solve brings me one step closer
        to my future career. <sup>15</sup> My professors have been a great help, guiding and challenging me to improve
        my skills. <sup>16</sup> I am also learning how to balance academics with self-care to avoid burnout.
        <sup>17</sup> The transition from second to third year feels like a big step, but I am ready to face new
        challenges. <sup>18</sup> I know the subjects will get harder, but I am determined to push through and continue
        improving. <sup>19</sup> College is not just about academics—it is also about personal growth and discovering
        what I am truly capable of. <sup>20</sup> Every experience, whether good or bad, is shaping me into the IT
        professional I aspire to be. <sup>21</sup>
